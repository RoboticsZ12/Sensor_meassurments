                                                   ACCELEROMETER TESTING DESCRIPTION:
                                                  ----------------------------------
  The leading thought of how to test the accelerometer sensor was to initially use a rover of sorts to test the acceleration of the sensor.
However, as we began testing, we found that none of the team members owned a high enough quality rover to accomplish the task. So, we 
improvised to a shake and go toy car. This car is purely mechanical and has a burst of acceleration for approximately 25 feet. 

  Since the shake and go car is relatively an old toy, we were unable to acquire a data sheet to set the ground truth. So, we used kinematics
to derive our own ground truth for acceleration and velocity. As stated before, since the car's motor runs for approximately 25ft, we can 
time how long it takes the car to drive to 20ft. This enables that our acceleration in CONSTANT acceleration. 

  We found that it takes the car an average time of 3.875s to reach 20ft. Taking the initial starting point to be 0ft and the final to be 20ft, 
we foudn that the equation for acceleration to be V = 2.7875*(Time) [ft/s], or 2.7883 ft/s^2, which is equavalent to .850 m/s^2. This gave us 
our ground truth that we could measure against.
