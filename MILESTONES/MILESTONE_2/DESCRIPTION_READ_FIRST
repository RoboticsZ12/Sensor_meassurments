                                                           DESCRIPTION OF MILESTONE_2:
                                                           ---------------------------

  Milestone_2 strictly consisted of testing and acquiring data to complete an overall presentation of all the findings of the section. 
These findings include the best way to test the sensors, as stated in milestone_1, specific characteristics of the sensors, comparing 
found data to spec/manufacturers data, and finally finding the percent error from the spec data. 

    All of these findings combined created Milestone_2. Provided in the "MILESTONE_2" file is all the RAW information/data acquired 
from the sensors. This data did have some erros that was brought to our attention from our professor, so the fixed/updated versions of 
the data can be found the "improvements" folder.
