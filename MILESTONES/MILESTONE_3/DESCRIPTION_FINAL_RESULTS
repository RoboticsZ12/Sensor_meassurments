                                                    FINAL DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
                                                    -----------------------------

  In this project, we learned the mulitiple aspects of how to solve for multiple characteristics of sensors. We had many 
successes in the project, but also many aspects that needed fixing, such as the accelerometer readings only being in the 
x direction. These fixes can be found in the "IMPROVEMENTS" folder. 
-------
DHT-11:
-------
  Overall, the results were quite promising for all sensors. The one sensor that gave the most trouble was the DHT-11 
temperature sensor. The DHT-11 tends to be quite challenging when trying to find a ground truth for the sensor. 
Our group, in particular, used two seperate ground truths. The first being the the weather app on our phones and 
the second being the thermostat of a house. 
------
PHONE:
------
  The phone's weather app proved to be a better ground truth since the location of the data that is being pulled
comes from a reputable source. When doing the calculations/readings, we found that DHT-11 actually calculated pretty 
close to the given temperature. Utilizing the data provided in "MILESTONE_2", we were able to calculate %error of the 
sensor. 
-----------
THERMOSTAT:
-----------
  The thermostat on the other hand proved to be quite inaccurate compare to the DHT-11 readings. The thermostat we 
utilized was a "Honeywell Home RTH6580WF". This specific thermostat utilizes a "RedLINKÂ® Room Sensor" for its temperature
depiction. According to the data sheet and multiple sources, the REDLINK room sensor is a reliable sensor that outputs 
good data. The one downside from utilizing the REDLINK sensor vs the DHT-11 depends on the size of the house being measured. 
If a larger house is being tested, obviously the upstairs readings will read higher than the basement readings for example, 
hear rises. For this fact, we cannot say with certainty that the room being measured by the DHT-11 is accurate at all to what 
the REDLINK sensor is outputting. 

--------------
ACCELEROMETER:
--------------
  The main method of testing was using the toy shake and go car described in the "accelerometer" file. However, as discussed in
the "IMPROVEMENTS" file, we only tested the x direction of the sensor. So, to fix this, we flipped the sensor 90 degrees to measure
both the y and z acceleration as well, once again can be seen in the "IMROVEMENTS->ACCELEROMETER". This enabled us to be able to 
mesure all axis of the accelerometer and not just the one direction of the x-axis. 
  The only component we ran out of time to test for was the angular acceleration. The idea was to use a similar contraption to what
was used by Luke from class. Basically attached the sensor to a drill to enable anm angular acceleration. Since the drill can be 
moved on different axis, we could have measured the x, y, and z angular accelerations with the drill. 
  With the exception of a few misreadings, the accelerometer read decent for the cost of the sensor. 

------------
ULTRASONIC :
------------
  The final conclusion for the ultrasonic sensor resulted quite positively. Out of all three of the sensors tested, this sensor
appeared to be the most accurate and precise of the three. After changing our initial box plan to the testing seen in the 
"IMPROVEMENTS->ULTRASONIC" file, we actually noticed the precision/accuracy increased significantly. We also found that the max 
range of 4m is a bit on the exagerative side. With that distance the ultrasonic waves are not as tightly compacted and dissipate 
more and more as the distance increases. 
  Every so often a reading, at the max range, would output correctly. However, for the sensor to be utilized efficiently, the 
testing should be kept to approximately half that length, approximatley 2~2.5m. This new data can be seen in the 
"IMPROVEMENTS->ULTRASONIC" file.
