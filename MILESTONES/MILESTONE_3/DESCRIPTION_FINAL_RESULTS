                                                    FINAL DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
                                                    -----------------------------

  In this project, we learned the mulitiple aspects of how to solve for multiple characteristics of sensors. We had many 
successes in the project, but also many aspects that needed fixing, such as the accelerometer readings only being in the 
x direction. These fixes can be found in the "IMPROVEMENTS" folder. 
-------
DHT-11:
-------
  Overall, the results were quite promising for all sensors. The one sensor that gave the most trouble was the DHT-11 
temperature sensor. The DHT-11 tends to be quite challenging when trying to find a ground truth for the sensor. 
Our group, in particular, used two seperate ground truths. The first being the the weather app on our phones and 
the second being the thermostat of a house. 
------
PHONE:
------
  The phone's weather app proved to be a better ground truth since the location of the data that is being pulled
comes from a reputable source. When doing the calculations/readings, we found that DHT-11 actually calculated pretty 
close to the given temperature. Utilizing the data provided in "MILESTONE_2", we were able to calculate %error of the 
sensor. 
-----------
THERMOSTAT:
-----------
  The thermostat on the other hand proved to be quite inaccurate compare to the DHT-11 readings. The thermostat we 
utilized was a "Honeywell Home RTH6580WF". This specific thermostat utilizes a "RedLINKÂ® Room Sensor" for its temperature
depiction. According to the data sheet and multiple sources, the REDLINK room sensor is a reliable sensor that outputs 
good data. The one downside from utilizing the REDLINK sensor vs the DHT-11 depends on the size of the house being measured. 
If a larger house is being tested, obviously the upstairs readings will read higher than the basement readings for example, 
hear rises. For this fact, we cannot say with certainty that the room being measured by the DHT-11 is accurate at all to what 
the REDLINK sensor is outputting.
