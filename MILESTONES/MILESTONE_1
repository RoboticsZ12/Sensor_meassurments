  As previously described in the "Read.me", milestone 1 was generating the basics of what sensors we were planning to test, 
specific characteristics we wish to measure, and devising a plan on how we are to test the sensor compared to a ground truth.

  There is not much to describe for the first milestone, however, the crucial component of milestone 1 is to devise a proper 
plan that will correlate the best with the chosen characteristics. 

  When finishing the initial submission of milestone 1, we noticed we had a few holes in our logic. Attached under "milestone 1" 
there is a renovated copy of the submitted milestone.
