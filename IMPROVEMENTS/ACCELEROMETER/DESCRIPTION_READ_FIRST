IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE TO INITIAL FINDINGS:

                                                 MP-6050 MODULE {Accelerometer}
  a. Measured initally only in X direction, as shown in image "X_AXIS". We should have turned sensor 90 degrees to also measure y
     acceleration, then 90 degrees in vertical direction to acquire z acceleration. These images are shown in previous menu. 
  b. Also, to measure the angular acceleration, we could have used a drill as doen by @Luke to
     generate a constant acceleration across each axis.
