IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE TO INITIAL FINDINGS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 MP-6050 MODULE {Accelerometer}
  a. Measured initally only in X direction. Should have turned sensor 90 degrees to also measure y
     acceleration, then 90 degrees in vertical direction to acquire z acceleration. 
  b. Also, to measure the angular acceleration, we could have used a drill as doen by @Lukas to
     generate a constant acceleration across each axis.
