                                                          -----------
  Unfortunately, we were unable to test the sensor inside the thermostat directly. However, we were able to compare its values 
to some online resources. According to online resources, according to the floor that the thermostat is located, depends on the 
accuracy of the sensor. The sensor the Honeywell thermostat utilizes is the "RedLINKÂ® Room Sensor". 
  For example, the thermostat we tested is on the main floor of the house. However, there is also an upstairs and basement.
This plays a major role in the readings. According to online resources, the main floor the sensor is located reads quite accurate 
to the actual temperature of THAT FLOOR. However, if there is a basement or upstairs, the thermostat reads quite inaccurately for 
those two variables. Since heat rises, the upstairs should read hotter and the basement should read colder that the thermostat reading. 
  This leads our ground truth to be a bit unworthy of being called a "GROUND TRUTH". We need a more reliable source if we were to do 
temperature readings of the inside of a house.
