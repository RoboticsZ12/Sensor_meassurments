                                            ULTRASONIC MODULE DESCRIPTION:
                                            ------------------------------
  Ultrasonic ranging module, we came about our initial testing design in a bit of a round about way. We initially thought 
that perhaps since the ultrasonic snesor uses ultrasonic waves to detect motion, we were thinking that since sound is 
transmitted though waves. This made us believe that perhpas the sound waves effect the readings of the ultrasonic waves.

  Using the boxes we were thinking that perhaps the box could capture the ultrasonic waves and block the sound waves. 
To an extent, we saw the results we intended. However, when presenting, we were told that we actually only needed a large
flat object to measure the distance. 
  Also, a major mistake on our side was that we stopped measuring our data at only 1.5m vs the max range of 4m. The data 
provided in the "ULTRASONIC" module shows the data from 0-1.5m. The correct data output is show in the "IMPROVEMENTS" tab.
