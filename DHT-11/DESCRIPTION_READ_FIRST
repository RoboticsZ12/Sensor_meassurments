  We had two portions/ground truths for this sensor. The first was the weather app on our phones, and the second 
being an indoor thermostat. According to the feedback after presenting, the phone option was a good ground truth. 
However, the ground truth for the thermostat was not. We needed to document what sensor was used in the thermostat
for our ground truth. This information can be found in the "IMPROVEMENTS->DHT-11" file. 
  The data acquired from our initial thoughts and readings can be found in the "DHT-11" folder.
