# Sensor_measurments Description

MRE_320 Assignment
-------------------
Sensors Measured:
1) Accelerometer
2) DHT-11
3) Ultrasonic Ranging Module

Project 1 Description:
----------------------
Measuring and testing different sensors was the key component to the first project. We were tasked to test and meassure 
three seperate sensors and take note of several key characteristics. These characteristics will aid in attempting to 
find the best possible circumstances each sensor is able to be tested in. 
Project one consists of three seperatate milestones. Each milestone must be met before continuation to the next milestone. 
The specifics of each milestone is listed below.

MILESTONE 1:
------------
To initially begin the project, the team must first create a plan of how the sensors should, and will be, measured.
This first step is to simply grow an understanding of each sensor and to expand each members thinking from a theoretical 
perspective, to a pratical perspective. Crucial in the industry.

MILESTONE 2:
------------
Once milestone 1 is complete, the task was to create a power point presentaion regarding testing techniques and results. 
Once data is acquired, we are to compare the acquired with the "spec sheet" of the ground truth we declared. If the 
device utilized did not provide a data sheet, then a derivation of the ground truth must be acquired and tested. Once
all data is compiled and ready, a presentation of our findings must be made. 

MILESTONE 3:
-----------
The final milestone brings us to GitHub. We are tasked to discuss our methods, our outputs, things that went well, things
that need improvement, and how we can make these improvements. All milestones, data, code, set-up, and improvements are provided in
the repository.
